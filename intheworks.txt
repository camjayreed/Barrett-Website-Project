Current:
- touch up the readme in github and make it look better, add sections like "how to setup", and "how to use".
- "sell" the project and answer barretts questions

Future:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas:
- Make it so the do not click button redirects you to a blue screen with a loading bar to "delete system 32" (Small Idea)
- Display a real time terminal on the right side of the homepage (Big Idea)
- make a tile frenzy like minigame with fading animation for black boxes, keeps score maybe (Big Idea)

Do No Click Button Idea Breakdown (Small Idea) ## COMPLETED ##
    1. if you click the button, a dark souls like animation will play with the background fading to black and dark souls red text appearing telling you
        that you have died, there will then be a reset button that just redirects to index
    2. if you click the button, the website will fake a bluescreen, maybe with a glitch animation or something, and then either
        automatically creash back into a reset (goto index) or keep glitching, freeze, show a loading bar to fix, then go back to index

Tile Frenzy Idea Breakdown (Big Idea) ## COMPLETED ##
    so im thinking a big box (border box) that contains many small boxes within (9x9), the small boxes would by default be white, but on game start 
    lets say 4 turn black, now when we click a black box it turns white and then we randomly select another box to turn black (it can be the same box).

    clicking a black box will get you 1 point, if you click 3 white boxes you lose and score will not submit
    there will be a timer for 45s and a high score tracker for keeping track of progress / giving incentive to play

    to keep track of high scores we could start a timer on a "start" button, then when time runs out just set the score as the high score if
    the number is higher than the previous once
    we could easily transfer this into a leaderboard system by sending the high score along with a username to our backend, and at the end of the game
    we could display a leaderboard with user names and scores sorted from highest to lowest

    leaderboard should have usersname,score,attempts total

Completed:
- Made it so that when a user registers in were only checking against specific usernames in our table instead of all of the data
- Write login logic that works with database
- Implement password hasing and salting when registering an account
- Make it so when the user logs in we check the entered password vs the hashed db password
- If a user is logged in, show a create article button - 1.3.26 @ 2:47am
- Ability to create an article, and save it to a database - 1.4.26 @ 3:57am
- losing my mind refactoring my database and site because somehow i forgot to account for titles - 1.10.26 @ 5:21am
- fully implemented articles into the database and made them all display on the homepage - 1.10.26 @ 6:37am
- finish stylizing the rest of the pages 1.11.26 @ 7:29am
- style within our scripts.js file so thats our created articles look nice 1.12.26 @ 5:47am
- if logged in user == user who created the article then the user may delete their own article 1.13.26 @ 7:39am
- allow users to logout 1.16.26 @ 1:52am
- fully implemented jwt tokens on login, so users cannot bypass checks to create and delete articles 1.16.26 @ 6:44am
- so i never really made the updates to this but i fully implemented the tilefrenzy idea so yea gg 1.20.26 @ 6:47am
- implemented my smaller idea of a blue screen kinda thing when you press the do not click button 1.20.26 @ 7:48am

Barretts Questions Section:
    Questions (Answer each in at least 3-5 sentences, at IT job I have been told multiple times about people 
        who would answer in like 1 sentence and they couldn't ever connect with these peeps and then they decided to not get the job. 
        Also if you can make this sound natural not like a clanker):

            1. What is this project (High level explanation not jumping into technical details)?

            2. What did you use to make this / technical details of it?

            3. Give me a "This is how everything works" type of talk, for this I mean more like 
                "A user goes on my site clicks X this then sends an API POST request that does Y" and so on. 
                Try if possible to do this without looking at code just completely off of memory. If you don't remember a bit mention 
                "I don't remember what it does after but I know eventually it does Y which touches mr Z" and so on.
            
            4. Why did you make this (Think of this as talking to interviewer you aren't going to say 
                "Barrett told me to make this" think WHY a project more)?

            5. Going into this project there were a lot of things you learned of everything you dealt with 
                (frontend, api, general backend, database, uploading/middleware) what interests you the most going forward?


Retrospective Questions (More informal, just like a vibe check overall, no sentence requirement like the others but more a 
    "Hey this is generally what I learned blah blah". Try to make them 2 or so sentences minimum response instead of single word but yee)
  
            1. What did you learn from it (don't just list tech we touched but like what did YOU learn with coding / how everything works together)?

            2. What did you enjoy from going through it?

            3. What did you hate going through it (if you didn't hate anything is there anything that annoyed you / you didn't want to do)?

            4. What was the most challenging thing you had to do with this (Doesn't have to be something you hated more something that was hard)?

            5. What do you feel confident in doing going forward and what do you feel the worst about?

            6. How did you enjoy it / overall questions moving forward
