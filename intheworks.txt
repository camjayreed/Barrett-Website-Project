Current:

i think articles will consist of a table holding title, user, text, and maybe comments 

if logged in user == user who created the article then the 
    user may delete their own article




Future:




Ideas:
Make it so the do not click button redirects you to a blue screen with a loading bar to delete system 32
Display a real time terminal on the right side of the index site




Completed:
Made it so that when a user registers in were only checking against specific usernames in our table instead of all of the data
Write login logic that works with database
Implement password hasing and salting when registering an account
Make it so when the user logs in we check the entered password vs the hashed db password
If a user is logged in, show a create article button - 1/3/26 @ 2:47am
Ability to create an article, and save it to a database - 1.4.26 @ 3:57am
