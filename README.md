This is a beginner web development project designed to help me get experience. 
Each feature of the site was a challenge given to me by a more experienced developer, my job was to implement it, figure out the logic, and make it work.

Current features:
A button that talks to the backend using an api call, when pressed the backend recieves the request and prints out a message showing that the button was clicked.

A text input that sends the users input to the backend on pressing submit, the backend will receive the request and print out the submitted text.

A username and password form that sends the values to the backend as a JSON object on submit. The backend receives the payload and can access the username and password separately for any desired logic.
